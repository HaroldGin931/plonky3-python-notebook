    "# 1. Recap: Understanding Traditional Merkle Trees\n",
    "## What is a Merkle Tree?\n",
    "A Merkle Tree is a data structure used to verify the integrity of data. It's a type of binary tree where each leaf node is a hash of a data block, and each non-leaf node is a hash of its child nodes. This structure allows for efficient and secure verification of data integrity.\n",
    "## Why Use Merkle Trees?\n",
    "Merkle Trees are widely used in blockchain technology, distributed systems, and version control systems. They allow you to verify that a piece of data belongs to a larger dataset without needing to access the entire dataset.\n",
    "## How Does a Merkle Tree Work?\n",
    "- Leaves: Each leaf node contains a hash of a data block.\n",
    "- Nodes: Each non-leaf node contains a hash of the concatenation of its child nodes.\n",
    "- Root: The root node is a single hash that represents the entire dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Imagine you have four data blocks: A, B, C, and D. The Merkle Tree would look like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "        Root\n",
    "       /    \\\n",
    "   Hash0    Hash1\n",
    "   /  \\      /  \\\n",
    " A    B    C    D\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Hash0 = hash(A|B)\n",
    "- Hash1 = hash(C|D)\n",
    "- Root = hash(Hash0|Hash1)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Build the merkle tree -> compute Hash0, Hash1, Root\n",
    "2. Prove leaf node B is in the tree -> compute the merkle proof [A, Hash1]\n",
    "3. Verify the merkle proof, ensuring the node B is in the tree. Check hash(hash(A|B) | Hash1) == Root\n"

    "## Why Generalize Merkle Trees?\n",

    "A Generalized Merkle Tree is an advanced version of a Merkle Tree that can accommodate different types of data, such as matrices with different dimensions.\n",

    "# 3. Understanding MMCS (Mixed Matrix Commitment Scheme)\n",
    "MMCS is a generalization of a vector commitment scheme.\n",
    "It supports committing to matrices and then opening rows. It is also batch-oriented; one can commit to a batch of matrices at once even if their widths and heights differ.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How MMCS Works:\n",
    "MMCS built upon Generalized Merkle Trees. Since Generalized Merkle Trees can handle different types of data, MMCS can handle matrices with different dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. commit: build a Generalized Merkle Tree from the matrices.\n",
    "2. open_batch: prove a node is in the tree <=> prove a row is in the matrix.\n",
    "3. verify_batch: verify a node is in the tree <=> verify the row is in the matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why MMCS?\n",
    "In STARKs, it requires to commit to multiple polynomials with different degrees: \n",
    "- Execution Trace. Multiple columns, each column is a polynomial.\n",
    "- Quotient Composition Polynomial.\n",
    "- Polynomials in FRI folding. Fold once, one new polynomial.\n",
