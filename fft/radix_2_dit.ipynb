    "### 1. Background of the problem\n",
    "#### 1.1 Example\n",
    "\n",
    "One representation of the polynomial is using coefficient form. Such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + a_3 x^3$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$g(x) = b_0 + b_1 x + b_2 x^2 + b_3 x^3$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally, if you want to compute the convolution of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, you would need to compute the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$h(x) = f(x) * g(x) = (a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + a_3 x^3) * (b_0 + b_1 x + b_2 x^2 + b_3 x^3) = c_0 + c_1 x + c_2 x^2 + c_3 x^3 + c_4 x^4 + c_5 x^5 + c_6 x^6$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a polynomial multiplication, and the complexity is O(N^2).Can we lower the complexity?\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we answer this question, let's take a look at another representation of the polynomial.\n",
    "#### 1.2 Coefficient form and evaluation form\n",
    "A polynomial in the variable x over an algebraic field F represents a function f(x) as a formal sum:\n",
    "$$f(x)=\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i*x^i$$\n",
    "such as the formula above:$f(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + a_3 x^3$, We call the values $a_0,a_1,a_2,a_3$ the coefficients of the polynomial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another form of a polynomial is called evaluation form, that means a point-value representation of a polynomial f(x) of degree-bound n is a set of n point-value pairs:\n",
    "$${(x_0,y_0),(x_1,y_1)...(x_{n-1},y_{n-1})}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "such as the polynomial $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ above:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(x) = (x_0, f(x_0)), (x_1, f(x_1)), (x_2, f(x_2)), (x_3, f(x_3))$$\n",

    "$$g(x) = (x_0, g(x_0)), (x_1, g(x_1)), (x_2, g(x_2)), (x_3, g(x_3))$$\n",

    "### 1.3 Do multiplication by evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "So we can see, if we want compute multiplication of two polynomial,the complexity of this is only O(N) by evaluation form. But we need expand the points first. 4 points are enough to represent a polynomial of degree 3. From previous section, we know that $h(x)$ is a polynomial. of degree 6. So we need at least 7 points to represent $h(x)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the steps of polynomial multiplication in point-value form is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Extend the fields of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ to at least 7 points.\n",
    "2. Compute the point-value form of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$.\n",

    "1. Extend the fields of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ to at least 7 points. We use 8 points for convenience. Later we will explain why we need to extend the fields and why we use 8 points.\n",
    "So new fields are $x_0, x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5, x_6, x_7$.\n",
